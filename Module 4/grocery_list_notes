IT 140 Final Project Script Two Draft Guidelines and Rubric
Grocery List Script
 
You will be working on this project in the Project Two: Grocery List Script module in Codio. 

Following the directions in that module, you will also be able to determine the exact placement of the comments you will need to make in the code. 

In the Codio activity you will work on having your script do the following three things:
1. User Input
2. Loop through the grocery list
3. Provide output to the console

After completing the activity, annotate the code. 

Specifically, your submission for the Grocery List script should address the following critical elements:

I. In Your Script (Annotated Text File):
Refer to the directions in the module in Codio for how to export out and comment your completed script.

A. Identify examples of four uses of list operations in the script using comments in your code. 
Be sure your examples address each of the following:
    i. Creating lists
    ii. Adding and removing data from a list
    iii. Accessing values in a list
    iv. Modifying values in a list

B. Identify examples of dictionary operations using comments in your code. 
Be sure your examples address each of the following:
    i. Creating dictionaries
    ii. Adding and removing keyâ€“value pairs
    iii. Accessing values using keys
    iv. Modifying values

C. Identify examples of loop structures using comments in your code. 
Be sure your examples address each of the following:
    i. Item-based for loops
    ii.  Index-based (range) for loops
    iii.  While loops
    

From the tutorial:
Customer enters name, price, quantity
