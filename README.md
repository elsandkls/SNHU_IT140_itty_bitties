# SNHU_IT140_itty_bitties
Took the python introduction class at SNHU called IT140, these are the ittybitty programs we wrote in the class, more like snipets of code, rather than programs. They are in whatever state they were in at the end of the class, I used them for testing so some may work, some may not.
